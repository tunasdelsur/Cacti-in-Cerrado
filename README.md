# Cacti in Cerrado

This repository contains the data and details of data processing presented and discussed in **Köhler et al. (2024) The Cerrado through cacti. _Journal of Biogeography_ - https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.14846.**
The main resulting file of occurrences can be found at '2.Tab_S1_Summary_Occurences_Vouchers_Cerrado_IBGE_Morrone.xlsx'


## Methods
We downloaded Cactaceae occurrences from GBIF (https://www.gbif.org/), iNaturalist (https://www.inaturalist.org/), and SpeciesLink (https://specieslink.net/) using their online platforms. On GBIF and iNaturalist, we applied the filter for the South American continent, and on iNaturalist we applied the 'Research' quality grade to retrieve occurrence records. We imported raw records on QGIS 3.10.2 Coruña (QGIS Development Team, 2023), and then kept the records that fell within the Cerrado circumscription of shape files of IBGE (2019) and Morrone et al. (2022), separately, using the tools of geoprocessing cut of QGIS. We revised and curated the remaining records one by one, assessing their identification, geographical coordinates matching the label description (discarding when not), and habitat information. Species currently worldwide widespread by ornamental, food, or other human-related use purposes were removed from the data (i.e. _Epiphyllum phyllanthus_, _Selenicereus setaceus_, _Opuntia ficus-indica_, _O. cochenillifera_, _O. monacantha_, _Pereskia aculeata_, and _P. grandifolia_). Also, occurrences with a clear mention or indication of cultivated (e.g., collected on fences, home gardens, and farms) were removed. To assess data quality and taxonomic ascertain of the occurrences, we kept only the records with a digitized image of the specimens. Each record was analyzed and scored as rupicolous (accordingly info on label or field images as 'yes', 'no', or 'not mentioned'), present within the Espinhaço Range (if fell within an adapted shapefile from Colli-Silva et al. 2021, as 'yes', or 'no'), and if occurring within Morrone et al., IBGE or both circumscriptions. Also, we examined the georeferenced records on GBIF of each species beyond the Cerrado circumscription to assign the center of distribution of each taxa, also consulting relevant monograph literature of Cactaceae (Schumman, xxx; Britton & Rose, 1919; Backeberg, ; Ritter, 1979-81; Leuenberger, 1986; Anderson, 2001 Hunt et al. 2006; Taylor & Zappi, 2004; Zappi & Taylor, 2020),  reporting if there are rupicolous occurrences of the species. For assignments of endemisms and metrics of species occurrences and distribution, we lumped to the species-level taxa that have subspecies. To generate the species richness map of Cactaceae, we downloaded the expert maps obtained from the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and the IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) Cactus and Succulent Plants Specialist Group (CSSG) available at https://www.iucnredlist.org. The richness map was created by superimposing individual expert range maps using functions of the R package 'raster', 'rgdal', and creating a raster file further processed on QGIS.
